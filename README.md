# Covid19 School Closures

## Installation

The model has been tested and developed using Python 3.10

Install into an appropriate (Python 3.10) virtual environment either by cloning the repository, then (from the repository root directory)

```
pip install -e ./
```

Or, for users who wish to install the package directly without obtaining the full repository;

```
pip install git+https://github.com/monash-emu/covid19_school_closures.git
```

The dependencies in pyproject.toml are permissive enough to install alongside other packages; for 
reproducibility we have also included a frozen piplist in req_frozen_win10.txt
